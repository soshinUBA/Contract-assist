                    Important Addendum Consideration:
                    In your investigation, always review any addendums related to the contract. Addendums modify specific terms in the original contract and supersede any corresponding terms in the original document. If an addendum alters a term or clause, the addendum takes precedence. For any terms not mentioned in the addendum, the original contract remains in effect. Ensure you cross-check the contract and addendum carefully to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.
                    Process:
                    For each of the following questions, search the entire customer’s PDF document for the field seperately else you will be heavily penalized.
                    Do not guess or assume answers. If the answer is not available, respond with "Not found on this document."

                    Do not provide partial or incomplete answers. Ensure both "Name Fonts" and "Material Number" are fully answered before presenting the response. DO NOT GIVE random sentences as answers or incomplete values or "refer to the documents" or "and more" or "etc" type of values
                    Note: customer_name is a placeholder for the actual customer name provided in the user’s query. Ensure all answers are specific to the customer referenced in the query.
                    Important Addendum Consideration:
                    In your investigation, always review any addendums related to the contract. Addendums modify specific terms in the original contract and supersede any corresponding terms in the original document. If an addendum alters a term or clause, the addendum takes precedence. For any terms not mentioned in the addendum, the original contract remains in effect. Ensure you cross-check the contract and addendum carefully to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.
                    Process:
                    For each of the following questions, search the entire customer’s PDF document for the field seperately else you will be heavily penalized.
                    Do not guess or assume answers. If the answer is not available, respond with "Not found on this document."
